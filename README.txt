Donovan's 7 Days to Die Modlets

The goal is to create a _less grindy_ experience in 7 Days to Die, so you can enjoy the other aspects of the game. As such, these mods only make changes to things like resource stack sizes and gathering, resource requirements, and experience requirements. Nothing has been changed to make the game "easier" in other ways.

I previously used an excellent XML config replacement made by SpikeDaddy, which he still maintains, so full credit to his work for my inspiration!
