# Donovan's 7 Days to Die Modlets

The goal is to create a _less grindy_ experience in 7 Days to Die, so you can enjoy the other aspects of the game. As such, these mods only make changes to things like resource stack sizes and gathering, resource requirements, and experience requirements. Nothing has been changed to make the game "easier" in other ways.

## The Modlets

These are all intended to work in unison, so feel free to mix and match to suit your needs, however, pay attention to any conflicts listed in the descriptions.

## History

I previously used a fantastic complete config replacement made by SpikeDaddy, so full credit to his work for my inspiration. However, I wasn't entire satisfied with some of the sweeping changes he made to suit his needs, so I set out to create my own.

With the addition of xpath modlets in the latest versions of the [7D2DLauncher utility](http://7d2dmodlauncher.org/7D2DModLauncher.html), I decided to convert his original work into a series of modlets and make them my own. If you used his configs previously, you'll find much of the same changes in here, but the numbers have been tweaked a bit; some up, but mostly down.

## Support
